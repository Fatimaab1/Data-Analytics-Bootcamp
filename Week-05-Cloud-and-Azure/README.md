# Week 05 – Cloud Computing & Azure Fundamentals

## Overview
In Week 5, I explored cloud computing concepts and Microsoft Azure as part of my data analytics bootcamp. The focus was on understanding cloud deployment models, security and legislation, and the capabilities of Azure services for data storage and analytics. I also applied this knowledge through hands-on practice assessments and a business proposal activity..
