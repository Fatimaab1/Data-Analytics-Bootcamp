# Data Analytics Bootcamp Portfolio

## Overview
This repository brings together the work I completed during a Data Analytics bootcamp, highlighting both my learning and hands-on experience. It provides an overview of the key topics covered and showcases selected examples of the practical work completed during the course.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I worked with Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and Microsoft Azure on practical exercises, building strong analytical thinking, technical skills, and confidence working with data.

## About Me & Key Highlights
Throughout the bootcamp, I developed a solid foundation in analysing, visualising, and interpreting data. I particularly enjoyed applying my learning to practical tasks, strengthening my problem-solving skills and understanding how different tools and techniques can be used to explore and work with data in real-world scenarios.


**Key skills and strengths developed include:**
- Applying analytical techniques to explore, clean, and interpret data across multiple tools and platforms
- Effectively presenting insights through dashboards and visualisations
- Demonstrating competence with Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Python
