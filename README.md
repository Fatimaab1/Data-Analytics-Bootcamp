# Data Analytics Bootcamp Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases my learning and practical work completed during a Data Analytics bootcamp. It demonstrates hands-on experience across the full data analytics workflow, including data cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and reporting using industry-standard tools.

Throughout the bootcamp, I developed practical experience using Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and Microsoft Azure while working with real-world datasets and business scenarios to strengthen analytical thinking, technical skills, and data-driven storytelling.

## About Me & Key Highlights
Throughout this Data Analytics bootcamp, I developed a strong foundation in analysing, visualising, and interpreting data to support informed decision-making. I particularly enjoyed working with real-world datasets and transforming raw data into clear insights using a combination of analytical thinking and practical tools.

**Key skills and strengths developed include:**
- Applying analytical techniques to explore, clean, and interpret data across multiple tools and platforms
- Communicating insights clearly through dashboards and visualisations
- Working confidently with Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and Python


This repository reflects both my technical development and my approach to learning — combining hands-on practice, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
